# COMP576_FinalProject
Brain tumor segmentation in MRI is important for diagnosis and treatment planning but remains a time-consuming, subjective task when marked manually by radiologists. Advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced automated medical image analysis. This project aims to replicate a 2019 study on reproducing the U-Net model for tumor segmentation and feature extraction. Beyond replication, we will evaluate and compare the traditional U-Net framework with newer architectures. We finally conducted four models including U-Net, U-Net++, FPN, and ResNeXt, to explore potential improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency. This work seeks to refine automated segmentation techniques, supporting more precise and consistent tumor analysis.
